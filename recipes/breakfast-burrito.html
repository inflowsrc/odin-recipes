    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add chorizo, poblano peppers, onions, and red bell pepper. Cook until vegetables are tender, 5-7 minutes. Remove skillet from heat.</li>
        <li>In a microwave-safe bowl, cook potatoes with a small amount of water until fork tender, about 7-10 minutes, stirring halfway through, and drain. Stir potatoes into the chorizo mixture.</li>
        <li>Whisk eggs, half-and-half, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add egg mixture and scramble until eggs are cooked, about 3 minutes. Remove eggs from heat and fold in the cheese.</li>
        <li>Heat tortillas in the microwave for 20-30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Spoon the chorizo mixture in a line across the middle of a tortilla, then add a layer of scrambled eggs. Fold opposing edges of the tortilla to overlap the filling. Roll 1 of the opposing edges around the filling, creating a burrito. Enjoy!</li>
